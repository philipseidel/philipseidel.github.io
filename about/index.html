<h3>Why not Facebook?</h3>
<p>Some might ask why I opt to share things on my personal web site rather than on Facebook so before we go any further let's hash this out.  The biggest reason is that I really don't want to spend my free time sitting on Facebook.  It is not that Facebook is not a great product as I really enjoy reading about the engineering and scale issues they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Another reason is that I like to own my content rather than just handing over the keys to it and my personal information to Facebook.  Lastly, the majority of my family isn't on Facebook and while this number continues to shrink it is a good enough reason to keep things where I want them.  Unfortunately, I recently did have to join Facebook in order to keep in contact with some friends which no longer believe in email.  It was a sad day but I rarely check in and even less frequently post anything.</p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I am a Systems Engineer for a large Internet company based out of Seattle, WA.  I have the benefit of dealing with the web operations at a massive scale.  At work we measure performance in milliseconds and throughput in 100k+ requests/second.  Dealing with systems that have to handle this kind of load is both exciting and challenging so that is why I am still with the same company after 7 years.</p>
<h3>Why Should I Read This?</h3>
<p>I don't have a good answer for you but if you enjoy reading about Internet operations, scalability, or you just want to check in to see what is new with family then this is where you should come.  However, if no one visits this site it won't really bother me because my goal is just to gather all the "stuff" which I find interesting in a single location online so that I can reference it and refresh my memory when the time arises.</p>
