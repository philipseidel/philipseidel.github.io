<p>Maggie, Owen and I got to spend our day off at <a title="Lyman Orchards" href="http://www.lymanorchards.com/" target="_blank">Lyman Orchards</a> enjoying what turned out to be one beautiful day despite the weather forecast.  Owen had a great time running around picking apples, pears, peaches, and raspberries for his teachers and our neighbors.  I have to say I was pretty impressed by the orchard which not only has plenty of trees to pick from but also a sunflower and a corn maze for the kids to run around in.  Here are a few pictures from the trip.  It is hard to believe that last year at this time Owen wasn't really able to pick on his own...  Time is flying by!</p>
