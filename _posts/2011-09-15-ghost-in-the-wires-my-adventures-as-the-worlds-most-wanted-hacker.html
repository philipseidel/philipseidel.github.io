<p>[amazon_template template="thumbnail-left" id="0316037729"][/amazon_template]I don't generally read too many books that aren't technical in nature but saw an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_Ysj7f5sE">interview</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_mitnick" target="_blank">Kevin Mitnick</a> on Triangulation and felt compelled to give this one a try.  I have to say that it was one of the most entertaining books I have every read.  There aren't too many books that I have had a hard time putting down but this was definitely one of them.</p>
