<p>It is hard to believe that Thomas is already 1 month old.  He just got back from the doctor last week and is weighing in close to 11 pounds already!!!  I have to say that he has been a very good baby and is only waking "us" up once in the night to eat.  Here are some pictures of the big guy.</p>
