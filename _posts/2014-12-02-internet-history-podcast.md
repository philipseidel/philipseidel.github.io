I recently came across the [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/ "Internet History Podcast") and I have to say I have been enjoying every minute of it.  I love history and especially love content that focuses on recent technology.  When I first heard about this podcast I was reminded of [Download The True Story of the Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_The_True_Story_of_the_Internet "Download The True Story of the Internet") which was a short series that was on Discovery a few years back.  I really enjoyed that series and was disappointed when it was canceled after the 4th episode.
