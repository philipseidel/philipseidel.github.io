<p>The pool hasn't caused us too much trouble since we moved here but this year it started leaking pretty bad.  I spent 6 hours one weekend digging out all the pipes (45 feet long and 2 feet deep) so that we could have them replaced.  It turned out that the original pipes had already been patched 7 times so it was definitely worth the time and money to get them out of there.  Hopefully, these will last 2o more years but who knows what lies in store for us in the future.</p>
