The Jeep has been a great truck over the years and it continues to drive well, but with Maggie going back to work it was time to buy something a little safer to drive the little guy to daycare in.   We just purchased a Ford F-150 which should prove to be pretty handy with all the home renovations and projects we have going on around here.  After 10 years of the basics it is pretty nice to drive around in a vehicle that has power locks and windows.  I plan on keeping the Jeep around for some time to come and look forward to trimming it out for some nice 4 wheeling.</p>
