<ul>
<li>When two devices on a network communicate they don't use IP but rather they use the protocols that are specific to the wire (data-link) itself such as electrical impulses for Ethernet</li>
<li>Data can be ant to an IP address, and the data will be encapsulated and transmitted according to the rules of each of the intermediary networks.</li>
<li>Routing occurs at the network layer (IP) while delivery occurs at the data-link layer (Ethernet)</li>
<li>The only thing that IP does is move data (datagram) from one host to another, one network at a time; provides relaying and delivery decisions</li>
<li>IP provides a virtual network onto of the physical network and uses IP datagrams to allow a host to send whatever data needs to be sent and IP packets to send this data according to the characteristic of each intermediary network</li>
<li>When a system has to send a datagram it looks at the routing table to find the appropriate network interface to send the outbound traffic through</li>
<li>RIP and OSPF are used to build routing tables but they are generally only run on routers so that not to add overhead on all hosts; then a routing table would only need the IP of the default gateway to get to a router which knows where to send the data</li>
<li>IP datagrams are unique entities which can travel across whichever route is best at that time; IP doesn't care if it gets lost, arrives out of sequence, etc.</li>
<li>Every IP datagram that is received must have its header against its checksum; no data is verified</li>
<li>The TTL of an IP packet is decremented by 1 before forwarding the packet and if the value reaches 0 it is destroyed; used to prevent undeliverable loops from occurring</li>
<li>MTU is the maximum amount of data the network can carry in a single frame; if the size of the datagram is bigger than the MTU then it needs to be fragmented to into multiple packets for transmission</li>
<li>Local networks use the same MTU so packets should not be fragmented</li>
<li>Fragments are not reassembled until they reach the destination system</li>
<li>IP offers direct support for prioritization of packets</li>
<li>0.0.0.0 is the default route which is used when the host does not know how to route the data</li>
<li>ARP is used to identify the hardware addresses of other dives on the same network</li>
<li>ARP issues broadcasts onto the network asking for a host with the specific IP address to respond with its hardware address; if it exists the response is sent directly to the requestor and added to the ARP cache to eliminate repeat broadcasts</li>
<li>If ARP cache timeouts are too high they can cause issues when IP addresses are changed</li>
<li>Inverse ARP is used to find the IP address of a hardware address</li>
<li>Gratuitous ARP is used when a device issues an ARP broadcast for the sole reason of keeping devices informed of its presence on the network; devices won't add but only update cache</li>
<li>Broadcasts are meant for every host on the network</li>
<li>Multicast allows for a system to send data to a group address; hosts can choose what network streams they want to monitor</li>
<li>Multicast allows for broadcast-like activity while providing support for remote hosts and networks on a selective basis</li>
<li>IGMP is not a transport protocol it is a control protocol useful for informing devices of network events and changes</li>
<li>The default TTL for a multicast datagram is 1; IGMP packets should only every have a TTL of 1 as they are only for the local network and should never be forwarded</li>
<li>Multicast group addresses are in class D (224.0.0.0. - 239.255.255.255)</li>
<li>Any host can send data to a multicast address; if it wants to participate in the group as a listener it must notify the local IP stack</li>
<li>The primary rule of a multicast router is to only forward multicast traffic to networks that have expressed interest in it</li>
<li>ICMP membership reports are sent by the host to the multicast address whenever a host wishes to participate in a multicast group</li>
<li>ICMP leave reports are used to announce that a particular host is no longer interested in receiving messages from the group</li>
<li>ICMP membership queries are used by routers to determine if ANY hosts are still listening to the group</li>
<li>Multicast routers are required for multicast across networks</li>
<li>Multicast datagrams are basically indistinguishable from IP datagrams so one way to test for basic multicast functionality is to ping the group address to determine which hosts are currently listening</li>
<li>ICMP is not a transport protocol but rather a control protocol used for informing devices of network events and changes</li>
<li>Semipermanent failures need to be reported to the sender immediately since these kinds of failures indicate that there is a problem in the way that the sender is trying to use the network</li>
<li>ICMP is used to send failure message back to a system when a semipermanent delver problem has been detected</li>
<li>Ping allows you to verify connectivity between devices using ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply</li>
<li>Traceroute allows you to identify the route that datagrams are taking on their war to a remote device; this is achieved by sending a services of packets with incrementally larger TTL values and monitoring ICMP Time Exceeded error messages as the packets expire on the their way to the destination</li>
<li>UDP provides a stateless, lightweight, and unreliable transport service which is appropriate for any application that has to issue frequent update messages or that doesn't require that every message gets delivered</li>
<li>Performance can be gained by removing the overhead associated with reliability and therefore applications that use it must implement their own error checking and fault management</li>
<li>Steaming applications benefit greatly from UDP because the individual messages are not as important as the overall stream</li>
<li>A socket is used to identify a IP address and port combination; socket pairs consist of both endpoints</li>
</ul>
