<p>Since embarking on my operations career I have written a ton of scripts, tools, daemons, etc. to allow our team to focus on the real work at hand.  Whether it be for data collection, monitoring, trending, or deployment processes operations teams do write a lot of code which is never seen but always used.  Writing these tools is only half the challenge; getting engineering to actually implement, instrument, consume these tools has been and still is quite a challenge.  Often times these tools are only used during tough times after already getting burned by an issue.  John makes some good points on collaboration and communication between operations and development teams in his <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2009/12/12/devops-cooperation-doesnt-just-happen-with-deployment/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and it is worth a read.</p>
