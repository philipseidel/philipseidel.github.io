<p>We had the first snowfall of the year this weekend and Owen had a blast playing out there.  There wasn't much for accumulation but it was the perfect amount for him to get out with the sled and play on his play scape.  I put together a quick video so click the &quot;read more&quot; link below if you are interested in watching.<br /><img src="/photos/20081214-01.jpg" border="0"><br /><!--more--><br />
