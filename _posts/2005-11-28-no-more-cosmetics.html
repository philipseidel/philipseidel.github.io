<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/" title="ESPN.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/ESPN_logo.svg/180px-ESPN_logo.svg.png" alt="ESPN" align="right" border="0" /></a>After two long years of working at Revlon in Manhattan I have decided to pursue a job opportunity with ESPN in Bristol, CT...  I am really anticipating actually working for a company who sells a product I can actually relate to...  I will surely not miss the 4+ hours spent commuting to the office every day, and I am looking forward to the career change.</p>
