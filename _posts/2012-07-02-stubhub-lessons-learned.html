<p>Here are a few good lessons shared by StubHub. Â There is a lot more information in the post but this is what caught my eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrument requests so that a request can be traced through the entire stack</li>
<li>There is nothing like failing to teach how to do things right</li>
<li>Invest in continuous improvement by performing postmortems and ensuring that issues don't come up again</li>
<li>Build operational valves into the system so that you can easily swap out components when needed</li>
<li>Implement multiple solutions and have a bake-off in production to determine which version works better</li>
</ul>
