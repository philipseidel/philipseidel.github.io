<p>For those of you that have ever been over our house for a bar-b-que you will be happy to know that there is finally a place to sit and relax.  We finally put on a deck to make this otherwise unusable space just a little more  usable.  I wish I could take credit for this project but our contractor did all the work on this on.</p>
