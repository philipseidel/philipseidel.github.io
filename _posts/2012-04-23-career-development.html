<div>Here is another good presentation by Theo where he talks about what it is to have a career in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_operations" target="_blank">web operations</a>.</div>
<ul>
<li>A career is a journey to become an expert
<ul>
<li>To be truly excellent you must treat it as a craft</li>
<li>You must become a craftsman</li>
<li>Through experience learn discipline</li>
<li>Through practice achieve excellence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps</li>
<li>Educate yourself
<ul>
<li>Discipline</li>
<li>Learn from and share from your peers</li>
<li>Be patient because experience takes a lot of time and mistakes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DevOps is BS because it is incomplete, isolated, and interpreted incorrectly.  What we need is .*Ops</li>
<li>Everyone in the organization needs an operational mentality including developers so it can be instrumented.</li>
<li>Operations role has to have expertise in resource planning, monitoring, root cause analysis.</li>
<li>Developers need expertise in dev but they are not as tactical as ops</li>
<li>Things just don't work; there is not magical pixy dust.</li>
<li>Virtualization was the game changer not the cloud.  Provisioning quick is key.</li>
<li>Provisioning is not operations job.  Managing risk and liability is painless if you skip it.  This is what operations does!  They handle this.</li>
<li>What you build will break; you can build operational software by having operational thinking.</li>
<li>A lot of engineers build code that isn't operable.  They don't design their code to introspected and operated.</li>
<li>Be able to debug it in production because that is where things actually break.</li>
<li>DevOps needs more ops in dev not the reverse.</li>
</ul>
