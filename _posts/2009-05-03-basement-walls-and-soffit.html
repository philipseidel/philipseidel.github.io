<p>Each weekend we get closer and closer to finishing the basement.  The heat, electric, walls, windows are all done and I just finished framing out the soffit.  There are only a few more small things to take care of before we install the ceiling and roll in some carpet.  Hopefully, it will only take a few more weeks tie up these loose ends; although the amount of time required to maintain the property this time of year will surely cut into my free time.</p>
