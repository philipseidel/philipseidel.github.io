<p>Owen celebrated his 3rd birthday this weekend and despite the fact that the weather would not cooperate we still managed to have a good time.  With Hurricane Bill on his way towards New England we suffered some pretty nasty tropical weather that forced us to cancel the party.  After all, what were we going to do with 20+ people sitting in house with humidity levels through the roof?  Despite the cancellation we still managed to throw something together with family and enjoyed some time out at the pool in between rain showers.  Hopefully, next year the weather will hold up...</p>
