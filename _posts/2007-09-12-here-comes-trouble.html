Open this, close that, pull this, push that, and then crawl as fast as possible.  It is not always possible to keep a close eye on him all day long so every once in a while we catch him doing something he shouldn't be.  Sometimes it is playing with the dog's bowls, attempting to climb the stairs, or getting into just about anything that he can fit into.  Here is a great picture of Owen getting caught red handed.</p>
