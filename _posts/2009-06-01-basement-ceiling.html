<p>We managed to tackle the entire basement ceiling this weekend and despite some very sore shoulders it went significantly faster than expected (thanks for the help Doug).  Throughout the course of this project there have been many clutch purchases that have made tasks a bit easier (framing nailer, electric stapler, rotozip, etc.).  If anyone ever has to cut out more than one hole in drywall for recessed lighting go spend the $30 and buy a recessed lighting hole saw.  It saved up so much time and we nailed a perfect fit with each cut.</p>
