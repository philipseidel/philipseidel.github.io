<p>After over a year in the making we finally finished the basement.  Owen has officially moved in all his toys and we finally have a living room free of clutter.  It took a little longer than we would have hoped but when there are only a few hours to spend on the project during the weekend it makes for a lengthy time line.  All-in-all I am very pleased with the result and Maggie can't wait to move into her new scrapbook room.  I think I am going to take the rest of the summer off and relax by the pool until a get another project underway...</p>
