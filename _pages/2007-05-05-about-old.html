<p><strong>Thanks for visiting my blog.</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully, I will be able to keep this site updated with everything that is going on in our lives these days. I have always wanted to develop my own website in my free time, but the tools available today make it too easy to spend the time. With all the house construction, a 1 year old, a wonderful wife, a crazy dog, and a full time job there are very few moments during the day when I can sit back and spend some time putting some thoughts online.</p>
<p><strong>A brief history...</strong></p>
<p>I spent 4 years studying Sociology and Computer Science at the State University of New York College at Geneseo. In my final year there I decided that my real interests were in technology rather than people, so I picked a few programming books and built my first web site. The first site I ever built was for a small insurance company owned by my wife's sister. Unfortunately, the company has been sold since then so I don't really have anything to show for it.</p>
<p>After college and a month long trip with my wife across country we found ourselves living down in Charlotte, North Carolina. I quickly found a job as a web developer for Piedmont Plastics, Incorporated where I designed, developed, and maintained their website. We spent a little over a year down there when we decided to move back to Long Island. While I enjoyed our stay down in North Carolina my wife, Maggie, found the teaching conditions far from optimal and we thought it would be best to go back to New York.</p>
<p>While in New York I worked for a few years at a small software development company that specialized in time tracking software. After 2 years I decided it was time to make the move to Manhattan to a bigger company. I was lucky enough to get a job at Revlon where I was a web developer responsible for the development, architecture, and management of their online properties. While working at Revlon I came to the conclusion that programming was not where my passion was. I found myself enjoying more of an operations role than that of a web developer. The desire to change careers, a brutal commute to the city, and the ridiculous price of houses on Long Island prompted Maggie and I to start looking for jobs outside the state. While Maggie loved her current job teaching in Long Island she knew that LI was not the place where we wanted to raise a family and settle down.</p>
<p>A month after our wedding in October of 2005 I moved to Connecticut and took a position as a Systems Analyst with ESPN. This position was a step backward for me on the career ladder, but I had high hopes that I would quickly find a position within the company that would be a better fit. During this time apart Maggie and I were blessed with the news that we were pregnant. Maggie was still teaching in LI and I was in CT which made this time apart even harder. However, we made the best of the situation and spent every moment we could together or on the phone. Having a baby meant that we needed to find a house, and fast. Our weekends were spent with our crazy realtor who was nice but far from organized which house hunting very interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>In February of 2006 we found a great house in a great neighborhood. It needed a ton of work, but Maggie and knew that it had some great potential. It had everything we wanted; a 2 car garage, a lot of land, and a basement. We closed on St. Patrick's Day that year and started working everyday to get it ready for the baby. We gutted the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and the basement. We turned one bedroom into a nursery, another into an office, and started painting and repairing the rest of the house. Work is far from done and probably won't be completed for a few more years, but it has come a long way since we moved in.</p>
<p>A few month's later I took a job with the Walt Disney Internet Group at ESPN as a Systems Engineer. This was an exciting move because it was right inline with what I had hoped to be doing before I changed careers. In a nutshell my team is responsible for the performance and uptime of espn.com and the rest of ESPN's online properties. The work is very challenging, fulfilling, and can be very stressful during certain events such as March Madness and football season.</p>
<p>In August of 2006 our son Owen was born. Aside from our wedding I can't remember a time so special. Being a parent is a lot more work than I ever expected, but it is worth it. No matter how many times I get up in the night his little smile makes my day every time I see him.  We are truly blessed with a happy, healthy boy.</p>
<p>And that brings us up to today...  Owen is now a year old, the house is coming a long, and Maggie is back teaching again at a new school in CT.  I am still with WDIG and hope that things continue to go well.</p>
